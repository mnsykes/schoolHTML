			<p class="essay">
				After reading through a few articles on Web Standards I really can’t see any reason why they shouldn’t be
				followed. The benefits of standardizing web specifications far outweigh any negatives. These standards provide a
				great framework for developers to create web sites for the masses.

				The biggest shock for me was learning that it was the creators of the individual browsers that were in control
				of the web prior to standardization and that developers would have to tailor their code to work with three or
				four different browsers in order for their site to be viewed properly in each browser. With browsers creating
				different functionality and features to compete with each other was bad for the consumer as well. In order to
				view a site the way the developer meant for it to be viewed you may have to use a different browser than the one
				you normally use. Imagine having to buy a particular brand of TV to watch a specific channel that couldn’t be
				viewed on other TVs. Having a choice in which browser you use to view the web is a good thing, but it should
				also be expected that they all behave they same way and provide the same viewing results.

				Industries that expect to have any sustainability must have best practices and standardization in place and the
				Web is no different. With the importance that the Web plays in our lives it’s imperative that there are
				standards to not only provide a common viewing experience but also an accepted framework of how the web is
				authored using existing languages, frameworks and technologies.
